***Solaris*** is an science fiction action-adventure game.

The game requires the player to search out an operating system looking for nine switches.

## Gameplay
Players take on the role of artificial intelligence One. One must try to infiltrate various directories within the operating system of the artificial star Solaris.

The operating system is made of a total of 9 rooms surrounded by mazes, with various obstacles and enemies. The operating system is guarded by "whistles", antivirus programs resembling polygons of different colors, protecting or fleeing from various items and attacking One.
